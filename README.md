# Outer_Earth

Outer Earth is, at a minimum, a tool for learning more about the astronomical phenomena that could be visible in the night sky to someone with a simple telescope or even unaided. It's currently under construction, but at a minimum we will have a gallery displaying the NASA astronomy picture of the day and a searchable database of all known asteroids and comets, with a select-few notable examples already listed.
